We propose backfilling the vacant Product Manager role with a Lead Software Engineer from the Customer Success team who has been instrumental in driving our enterprise GenAI platform initiative.

This platform is being built as a product to enable scalable, governed deployment of GenAI use cases across the organization. It demands a unique blend of product thinking and deep hands-on expertise with GenAI tools, frameworks, and integration patterns—skills this individual has already demonstrated.

Their continued leadership ensures continuity, accelerates delivery, and safeguards the platform’s strategic vision. Losing this momentum would delay key outcomes and dilute impact across multiple business units. Backfilling their current role enables us to unlock critical GenAI value at scale while maintaining continuity in Customer Success.

This transition is vital to sustaining enterprise innovation and speed of execution.
